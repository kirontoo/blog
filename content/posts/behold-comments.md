Look! I finally added comments!

There were many options that I could've gone with for this blog but in the end
I decided to go with [cactus comments](https://cactus.chat).
From reading the docs, cactus seemed REALLY easy to set up with Hugo, and it was!
The docs were quite straight forward and everything worked as intended.
Styling the comments to blend in with the theme took forever, but it was quite fun.
