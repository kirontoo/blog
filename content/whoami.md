Hey there! I'm Amy, a frontend developer who loves mechanical keyboards and
learning new things.

This blog will pretty much be me documenting things I find
interesting, new things that I've learned. No idea how often I will post but meh.

You can check out the things I've worked on at [rxkiro.xyz](https://rxkiro.xyz/).
And you can [click here]({{< ref "contact" >}}) to find out how to contact me.
